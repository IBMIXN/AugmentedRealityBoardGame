## Augmented Reality Starfleet Command Game (Dev Branch)

This holds the Unity project for the Team20 software engineering group project.

There is currently a slight bug within the Unity editor where it doesn't like to open a default scene in - it defaults to an "Untitled" scene. Also, a reimport-all is sometimes
required as Unity seems to be iffy with certain versions used with Git.
